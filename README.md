# Portofolio site
This site is a simple portfolio displaying a few projects I have done work on previously.

# credits and used code
While most code is done from scratch, the navbar is a public use bootstrap element from bootstrap 5.3 with custom styling applied.
Most images are screencaps of previous projects, and you can view these repos and the ownership of those images at my github linked here:
https://github.com/CovenantKid
You can find bootstrap 5.3 here:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/
